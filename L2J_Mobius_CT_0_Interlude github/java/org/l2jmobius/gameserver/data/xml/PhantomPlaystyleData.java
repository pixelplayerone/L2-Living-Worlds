/**
 * Per-class combat playstyles for recruited phantom party members, loaded from
 * {@code data/PhantomPlaystyles.xml}. A playstyle is an ORDERED list of skill entries (document order =
 * priority); each entry names a skill id, a use category, and the conditions under which a phantom of
 * that class should cast it. The playstyle engine walks the list each combat tick and casts the first
 * entry whose conditions pass - everything the class knows but the playstyle does not list is
 * deliberately NOT used (curation is the point: a Bladedancer spamming Poison Blade Dance reads as a
 * bot; one that saves Medusa for a crowded pull reads as a player).
 * <p>
 * Hard skill mechanics (cast range, MP, reuse, item consume, cast-time HP gates like Frenzy's) are NOT
 * duplicated here - they come from the live {@code Skill} object at cast time. The XML only encodes the
 * tactical layer the skill data cannot express: when a human of that class would bother.
