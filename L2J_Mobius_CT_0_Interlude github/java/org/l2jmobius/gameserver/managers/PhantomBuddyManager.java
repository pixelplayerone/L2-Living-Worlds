/**
 * Personal support buddy brain.
 * <p>
 * A buddy is a support-class phantom (Elven Elder / Prophet / Warcryer) spawned idle in a town by
 * {@link PhantomManager}. A real player can whisper it, party it (the invite is auto-accepted server-side
 * by {@code RequestJoinParty}), and use it as a personal buffer/healer. Once partied this manager keeps the
 * owner buffed and topped up to roughly half health, keeps itself buffed, follows the owner, warns when its
 * MP runs low and sits to recover when safe, teleports to a named gatekeeper destination on command, and
 * survives a grace period if the owner teleports away or briefly logs off.
 * <p>
 * Everything here is rule-based and works with the LLM brain offline; the whisper command parser is
 * deterministic. (Phase 2 will route natural language through the brain on top of this.)
